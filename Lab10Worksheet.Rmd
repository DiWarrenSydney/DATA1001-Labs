At the end of this Worksheet, you should be able to:

- use the "Box Model" and the Hypothesis Testing framework to perform a Proportion Test, using the Sanple **Sum**.
- interpret p-values.


<br>

**Recap on the "Hypothesis Testing" framework**

- See [Lecture](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/lectures/28.HypothesisTesting.html) and [Lecture](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/lectures/29.ProportionTest.html).

- The structure of a hypothesis test is H A T P C.

- For a box model contructed around a certain null hypothesis, the **observed value of the test statistic** is **(observed value - expected value)/SE**, 

where the observed value is calculated from the sample and the EV and SE are calculated from the box model.

<br>

**Hints:** 

- Draw the HATPC scaffold for your scenario and apply the box model

<br><br>

# Have a go

- Explain the structure of a hypothesis test using an annotated diagram, and example.

<br><br><br><br>

- In your own words, explain what a p-value is.

# `r icon::fa("pills")` Probiotic treatment for peanut allergy  

A team from [Murdoch](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-17/new-peanut-allergy-treatment-longlasting-study-says/8814264) has been studying long-term clinical and immunological effects of probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy after treatment cessation. The trial consisted of a 4-year follow-up of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In the Treatment group, 26 of the 29 patients showed improvement ("desensitisation").

It is claimed that *more* than 80% of people respond to the treatment. Test this hypothesis.

## Preparation

Draw a simple box model, with any population and sample details identified.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Hypothesis Test


### H {-}

- Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.

Ho:  The proportion of patient who respond to the treatment ("desensitise to peanut allergy") is _______

H1: The proportion of patient who respond to the treatment ("desensitise to peanut allergy") is *more than* _______

- Add the null hypothesis to the box model above, with the specific proportions of 1 and 0 in the box. Calculate the mean and SD of the box.


### A {-}

Write down any assumptions.

### T {-}

- For a sample of size 29 from the box, what is the expected value (EV) and standard error (SE) of the **Sum** of the sample?

<br><br>

- What is the formula for the test statistic?

- What is the observed value of the test statistic?


### P {-}

Assuming a Normal curve to model the **Sum** of the sample, what is the approximate p-value?

<br><br>

### C {-}

What is the conclusion?  

<br><br>

# `r icon::fa("bitbucket")` Pepsi and Coke  

In a market research study, 1000 people were given a sample of both Coke and Pepsi (in a random order) and asked which they prefered in taste. 52% of people preferred Coke. Researchers calculated a p-value of 0.19.

It is claimed that there is *no difference* in people's preference for Coke and Pepsi. Test this hypothesis.

## Preparation

Draw a simple box model, with any population and sample details identified.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Hypothesis Test


### H {-}

- Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.

Ho:  The proportion of people who prefer Coke over Pepsi is _______

H1: The proportion of people who prefer Coke over Pepsi is *not* _______

- Add the null hypothesis to the box model above, with the specific proportions of 1 and 0 in the box. Calculate the mean and SD of the box.


### A {-}

Write down any assumptions.

### T {-}

- For a sample of size 1000 from the box, what is the expected value (EV) and standard error (SE) of the **Sum** of the sample?

- What is the formula for the test statistic?

- What is the observed value of the test statistic?


### P {-}

Assuming a Normal curve to model the **Sum** of the sample, what is the approximate p-value?

<br><br>

### C {-}

What is the conclusion?

# `r icon::fa("uber")` Uber 

[Uber](www.uber.com/en-AU/cities/sydney/) is comparing customer satisfaction in Sydney over the past month, compared to the historical average of 80% satisfaction. This month, 948 of 1,200 Sydney customers were happy.

Is there *any difference* between this month's Uber satisfation and the *historical amount*? Perform a hypothesis test using the Sample Sum.

<br><br>

Note: All these questions could have been solved using the Sample **Mean** instead of the Sample **Sum**. Have a go.
