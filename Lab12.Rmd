# Live Demo

We will demonstrate a chi-squared test and regression test.

# Coding Challenge

We will look at the `cats` data set from the `MASS` package. Using the `summary` function find the p-value of the T-test to test the slope of the variables `Hwt` (Heart Weight) against `Bwt` (Body Weight).

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r, warning = F, message=F}
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)

model = lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)

# First check assumptions
plot(model, which = 1:2)


```


The plots show that the assumptions for a linear model are okay. The residuals are homoscedastic and normally distributed.

```{r}
summary(model)   # Gives us the p-value
```

</details>
