At the end of this Worksheet, you should be able to use the Normal distribution in a vertical strip, to work out chance for a linear regression model.

# Vertical strips {-}

(i) Read the lecture notes carefully [here](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/JM/DATA1001/r/current/lectures/16.ResidualPlot.html#27): from page 27 to the end.
Draw a picture to represent this result.

(ii) Assume the air quality index (AQI) in CE Sydney can be modelled by a Normal, with mean 50.77 and SD 21.88. On what percentage of days, would you predict the CE AQI to be above 80?

(iii) Now consider the days that had CE AQI to above 80. On what percentage of days, would you predict the NW AQI to be above 90?
