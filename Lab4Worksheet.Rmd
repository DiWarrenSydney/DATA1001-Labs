At the end of this Worksheet, you should be able to model a variable by a Normal curve, and explain how to estimate areas under the curve, using the 3 known thresholds (68%, 95%, 99.7%).

- It is vital that you draw a *quick sketch* of the Normal curve that you are considering, *before* you attempt any calculations.
- The *area under the curve* up to point $x$, represents the *chance* (or "probability") of getting a value less than or equal to $x$.

<br>


# Normal Model

Pick something your could measure in your home. Sketch a possible Normal curve and explain the 3 thresholds.

<br>


# Standard Normal Curve

The Standard Normal curve has mean 0 and standard deviation (SD) 1, and is written as  N(0,1):

- Draw the curve and the 3 thresholds (68%, 95%, 99.7%)
- What is the area under the curve between -1 and 1?
- Estimate the area between -2.5 and 2.5.
- What is the 84% percentile?
- Estimate the 60% percentile.

<br>


# General Normal Curve

A General Normal curve has mean 10 and standard deviation (SD) 3, and is written as  N(10,3^2):

- Draw the curve and the 3 thresholds (68%, 95%, 99.7%)
- What is the area under the curve lower than 7?
- Estimate the 30% percentile.

First consider the heights of Australian men.

- According to the [ABS](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4338.0main+features212011-13), what is the **mean** height of Australian men?

- Assume a **standard deviation** of 10cm for the heights of Australian men. Draw a Normal curve representing the heights.

- What percentage of Australian men are between 165.6cm and 185.6cm?

- If 50% of Australian men are below a certain height, what is that height?

<br>

In the Australian Football League (AFL) recruiters tend to look for tall male players. 

-  According to the [HeraldSun](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/size-matters-at-afl-level/story-e6frf9jf-1226650225771), what is the minimum height that recruiters look for? 

- Using the Normal curve above, estimate the chance of finding an Australian man able to be recruited for AFL?

<br>

West Coast ruckman Nick Naitanui is 201cm tall.

- What is the chance of finding an Australian male taller than Nick?

<br>

# <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>  Notes on using R

- By convention we represent a Normal curve by $N(mean, SD^2)$.
- However, in R the `pnorm()` command requires`pnorm(threshold, mean, SD)`.
  - `pnorm(x)` calculates the lower tail of the Standard Normal curve from `x` down.
  - `pnorm(x,lower.tail=F)`calculates the upper tail of the Standard Normal curve, from `x` up.
  - `qnorm(x)` calculates the x% percentile of the Standard Normal curve.

<br>

1. Which of the following pairs of parameters, defines a particular Normal curve?
<br>
(A) mean and median
<br>
(B) mean and interquartile range
<br>
(C) median and standard deviation
<br>
(D) mean and standard deviation
<br>
(E) range and outliers

2. Which command works out the area under the curve for $X \sim N(284.3,5.52^2)$?

```` {r fig.height=2.5,echo=F}
curve(dnorm(x, mean = 284.3, sd = 5.52), xlim = c(270, 300),ylab="",axes=FALSE)
abline(h = 0)
sequence <- seq(270, 275, 0.1)
polygon(x = c(sequence,275,270),
        y = c(dnorm(c(sequence),284.3,5.52),0,0),
        col = "red")
axis(1, at=c(270,275,284.3), pos=0)
```

(A) `pnorm(275,284.3,5.52)-pnorm(270,284.3,5.52)`
<br>
(B) `1-pnorm(275,284.3,5.52)-pnorm(270,284.3,5.52)`
<br>
(C) `pnorm(275,284.3,sqrt(5.52))-pnorm(270,284.3,sqrt(5.52))`
<br>
(D) `1-qnorm(270,275)`
<br>
(E) `1+qnorm(270,275)`

3. Which command will calculate $P(X > 1.2)$ when $X \sim N(3,4)$?
(A) `1-pnorm(1.2,3,4)`
<br>
(B) `qnorm(1.2,3,4)`
<br>
(C) `pnorm(1.2,3,2,lower.tail=F)`
<br>
(D) `1-pnorm(1.2,3,4,lower.tail=F)`
<br>
(E) `pnorm(1.2,3,2)`
